# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Simulation to Reality

**A Comprehensive University-Level Textbook**
**Version 2.0.0** — Now with Interactive RAG Chatbot 🤖

## Welcome

Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, a comprehensive textbook designed for university students and practitioners seeking to master the design, simulation, and deployment of autonomous humanoid robots.

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This textbook introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. You will learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using industry-standard tools: ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## What You Will Learn

Upon completing this textbook and associated projects, you will be able to:

1. **Design and Architecture**
   - Design complete embodied AI systems for humanoid robots
   - Select appropriate sensors and actuators for robotics applications
   - Architect ROS 2-based robot control systems

2. **Simulation and Modeling**
   - Create high-fidelity robot simulations in Gazebo, Unity, and Isaac Sim
   - Model robot kinematics and dynamics using URDF/SDF
   - Generate synthetic training data for robot learning

3. **Perception and Navigation**
   - Implement Visual SLAM for localization and mapping
   - Deploy hardware-accelerated perception using Isaac ROS
   - Configure autonomous navigation systems using Nav2

4. **Control and Locomotion**
   - Implement bipedal walking controllers
   - Design manipulation and grasping systems
   - Ensure stable balance and fall recovery

5. **AI Integration**
   - Integrate Large Language Models for cognitive planning
   - Implement voice-to-action systems using speech recognition
   - Design multi-modal interaction systems

6. **Deployment**
   - Transfer learned behaviors from simulation to reality
   - Deploy AI models to edge devices (NVIDIA Jetson)
   - Optimize models for real-time performance
